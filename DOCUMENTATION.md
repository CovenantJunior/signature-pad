# Signature Pad Documentation

![Signature Pad](https://github.com/CovenantJunior/signature-pad/raw/master/assets/signature-pad-demo.gif)

Signature Pad is a lightweight JavaScript library for adding a signature pad functionality to your web applications. It provides an intuitive interface for users to draw their signatures using a mouse, touch, or stylus input. This documentation will guide you through the installation, usage, and customization of Signature Pad.

For example, to open the repository in Visual Studio Code:
```bash
code .
```

## Usage
To use Signature Pad, an HTML canvas element was created and initialize with the SP class. Here's an example of how to use Signature Pad:

```bash
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Signature Pad Demo</title>
    <script src="path/to/signature_pad.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <canvas id="signature-pad" width="400" height="200"></canvas>

    <script>
      // Get the canvas element
      var canvas = document.getElementById('signature-pad');

      // Create a new instance of SP
      var signaturePad = new SP(canvas);

      // Do something with the signature
      function saveSignature() {
        var dataURL = signaturePad.toDataURL();
        // You can now send the dataURL to your server or process it further
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
In the example above, we create a canvas element with the ID "signature-pad" and initialize it with SP. We also define a saveSignature function that can be called to get the signature data as a base64-encoded PNG image.


## API Reference
Signature Pad provides a simple API to interact with the signature pad. Here are the main methods available:

* `new SP(canvas [, options])`
* `signaturePad.isEmpty(): boolean`
* `signaturePad.clear()`
* `signaturePad.fromDataURL(dataURL [, options [, callback]])`
* `signaturePad.toDataURL([type [, encoderOptions]])`
* `signaturePad.toData()`
* `signaturePad.fromData(pointGroupArray)`
* `signaturePad.off()`
* `signaturePad.on()`
* `signaturePad.onBegin(event)`
* `signaturePad.onEnd(event)`

Here are the main methods available:

### `new SP(canvas [, options])`

Creates a new instance of SP and attaches it to the specified canvas element.

* `canvas`: The HTML canvas element.
* `options` (optional): An object containing additional configuration options for SP ([see Customization](#customization)).

### `signaturePad.isEmpty(): boolean`
Checks whether the signature pad is empty (no drawn signature).

Returns:

* `true` if the signature pad is empty.
* `false` otherwise.

### `signaturePad.clear()`
Clears the signature pad, removing any drawn signature.

`signaturePad.fromDataURL(dataURL [, options [, callback]])`
Loads a signature from a data URL and displays it on the signature pad.

* `dataURL`: The base64-encoded data URL of the signature image.
* `options` (optional): An object containing additional options for loading the signature.
* `callback` (optional): A callback function to be called after the signature has been loaded.

### `signaturePad.toDataURL([type [, encoderOptions]])`
Converts the drawn signature into a data URL representing a base64-encoded image.

* `type` (optional): The image format to use (e.g., "image/png", "image/jpeg").
* `encoderOptions` (optional): The quality of the image encoding (0-1).

Returns:

* A data URL representing the signature image.

### signaturePad.toData()
Retrieves the signature data as an array of objects representing each point on the signature path.

Returns:

* An array of objects with the following properties:
    - `x`: The x-coordinate of the point.
    - `y`: The y-coordinate of the point.
    - `time`: The timestamp of the point.

### `signaturePad.fromData(pointGroupArray)`
Loads a signature from an array of point groups.

* pointGroupArray: An array of point groups, where each group is an array of points.

### `signaturePad.off()`
Disables the signature pad, preventing further drawing.


### `signaturePad.on()`
Enables the signature pad, allowing drawing.


### `signaturePad.onBegin(event)`
A callback function triggered when drawing begins.

* event: The event object associated with the drawing.

### `signaturePad.onEnd(event)`
A callback function triggered when drawing ends.

* event: The event object associated with the drawing.

## Customization
Signature Pad provides several options for customizing its behavior. These options can be passed as an object when creating a new instance of SP. Here are the available options:

* `backgroundColor` (default: `"rgb(255, 255, 255)"`)
* `penColor` (default: `"rgb(0, 0, 0)"`)
* `velocityFilterWeight` (default: `0.7`)
* `minWidth` (default: `0.5`)
* `maxWidth` (default: `2.5`)
* `throttle` (default: `16`)
* `minDistance` (default: `5`)

Example Usage:

```bash
    var signaturePad = new SP(canvas, {
        backgroundColor: 'rgb(245, 245, 245)',
        penColor: 'rgb(0, 0, 255)',
        minWidth: 1,
        maxWidth: 3,
        throttle: 10,
    });
```
